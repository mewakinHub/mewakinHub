- **Greedy Garden Game Development Project As Design Pattern Lead**
  - **Performance Optimization**:
    - Implemented **Singleton Pattern** to reuse sprite sheets across the program lifecycle, minimizing redundant loads and boosting efficiency.
    - Used **Dependency Injection** to share objects across classes, ensuring consistent state management and streamlined gameplay logic transitions with a **state machine**.
  - **Scalable Architecture**:
    - Designed the system with **SOLID principles**, making the codebase highly maintainable and efficient for future updates.
  The game was deployed on **Itch.io** for **Windows and Linux** with strategic, replayable mechanics for competitive play:
