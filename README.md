# Hi there! üëã

![Profile Image](assets/profile1.jpg)

I'm a **Digital Engineering (DE) student** pursuing a Bachelor's degree with a deep passion for **Computer Vision (CV)** and **Machine Learning Engineering (MLE)**. I have aspirations to study abroad and connect with people from various cultures, using English as a global communication tool to bridge gaps and foster innovation. Currently, I'm interning at **Axons, CPF** as an MLE and MLOps engineer, where I'm actively contributing to multiple impactful projects.

## üöÄ What I'm Working On

### üåü Internship at Axons
**Intern - MLOps & Machine Learning Engineering**

- **MLOps - Pattern Design & Integration:** Collaborated with the pattern design team to create a SOLID model training pipeline POC and integrate multiple Dependency Injection frameworks using the Adapter Pattern. Currently focused on assisting with the implementation of a hexagonal architecture pattern to make data science workflows more seamless. This role involves working closely with the team to refine patterns that ensure scalability and maintainability in real-world applications.

- **Computer Vision (CV-MLE) - Edge Device Deployment:** Independently deployed a real-time bag detection model on edge devices and developed an application for counting bags. This application was designed to be user-friendly, allowing customers to run it with a single click or have it start automatically upon booting their PC. Gained hands-on experience with hardware constraints and performance testing. Developed critical insights into customer requirements and real-world system challenges, such as optimizing trackers for conveyor belt systems and effective communication through diagrams and presentations.

- **CI/CD & Azure DevOps:** Built and managed CI/CD pipelines using Azure DevOps. Applied SOLID principles to maintain clean, modular code, while actively engaging in backlog management and repository setup. Focused on optimizing CI/CD processes to meet real-world demands and ensure smooth project integration.

- **ML Intensive Course:** Developed a deep understanding of Data Science (DS) workflows, particularly in DS notebook writing and practical data processing, through an intensive ML course designed to bridge academic knowledge with industry practices.

### üéì University Projects
- **Thesis on Multiple Sentiment Analysis:**  
  Currently conducting research on sentiment analysis, which is the focus of my university thesis.
- **Cloud-Based Systems, Pygame, Blockchain, AI, and Mobile App Development:**  
  Completed various projects during my academic journey, ranging from cloud-based systems to game development and blockchain technology.

## üé® Hobbies and Interests
Outside of my professional and academic pursuits, I enjoy drawing and streaming, especially on weekends. I‚Äôm currently working on building a dual-PC setup for streaming, where I can showcase my original character (OC) drawings and explore Live2D animation. However, I've had to put these hobbies on hold recently as I focus on growing in my job and balancing both work and study. Once everything settles, I plan to dive back into my creative passions.

## üå± My Vision
I‚Äôm curious and eager to explore various fields and technologies. I enjoy tackling new challenges and constantly learning. My passion for computer vision, especially in applications like self-driving cars, drives me to continually improve my skills. I aspire to be like Nam Do-san from "Startup," contributing to groundbreaking innovations in technology.

## üåç Upcoming Exchange Program
I'm excited to share that I will be participating in an exchange program next year at **Northumbria University** in Newcastle, UK. This opportunity will allow me to broaden my horizons, experience new cultures, and further my education in a global context.
